# Using SmartShape2D with Godot 4

Godot 4 no longer offers `repeat` import option for textures. On how to make textures repeat and
set normal maps see [section below.](#repeating-textures-and-normal-textures-with-canvastexture)

By default, **shape resources are shared** when the shape is copy-pasted. Editing points will edit every copy of that shape.
To make point geometry unique, press **"Make Unique"** property button in Geometry property group in the inspector:

## Repeating Textures and Normal Textures with CanvasTexture

Normal textures are no longer set in a material resource.

To set normal textures, you can create a `CanvasTexture` resource in the inspector on any property, that allows setting a `Texture2D`.

![Creating CanvasTexture](imgs/godot4-create-texture-res.png)

`CanvasTexture` allows you to assign diffuse texture and normal map texture, as well as set textures to `repeat`:

## Converting Projects from Godot 3.x

Scene files with shapes saved in Godot 3.x should load in Godot 4 project. However, you may encounter some issues. Here is a list of expected problems:
1. Textures are looking weird, not repeated.
2. Normal textures are not used.

Please read the section on [how to set repeat and use normal textures in Godot 4](#repeating-textures-and-normal-textures-with-canvastexture).

## Removed Features

- The Godot 4 version of this addon does not support 1.x RMSmartShape2D nodes anymore.
- SS2D_Shape_Meta node was removed, since its functionality is available  copy-pasted shapes by default.
