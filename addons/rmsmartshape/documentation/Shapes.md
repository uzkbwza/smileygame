# SmartShape2D - Shapes

Each shape consists of a set of points. You can directly edit either the points or the edges between the points in the viewport.

Shapes are configured to use a [Shape Material](./Resources.md#ShapeMaterial) which determines how the shape is rendered.

A shape can be open or closed. Each new shape starts open. To close a shape, simply add a point on top of the first one.


## Properties

> ðŸ›ˆ Most properties now have documentation comments.

<!-- TODO: this is incomplete - not all properties are here -->

### Editor Debug

- Will show the bounding box for each quad in the mesh of edges.
- Can be helpful to illustrate why a shape doesn't look the way you expect.

### Flip Edges

- Will flip the edges of the shape (invert y).

### Render Edges

- Whether or not the edges of the shape should be rendered.

### Collision Size

- Size of the collision shape.

### Collision Offset

- Offset of where the collision shape starts and ends.
- A **positive** value offsets the collision shape **outwards**.
- A **negative** value offsets the collision shape **inwards**.

### Tessellation Stages

- Number of stages in the curve tessellation process (Uses Curve2D Internally).
- First Param in Curve2D.tessellate.
- See [Curve2D Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/classes/class_curve2d.html#class-curve2d-method-tessellate).

### Tessellation Tolerence

- Tolerence Degrees in the curve tessellation process (Uses Curve2D Internally).
- Second Param in Curve2D.tessellate.
- See [Curve2D Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/classes/class_curve2d.html#class-curve2d-method-tessellate).

### Curve Bake Interval

- Bake interval value for Curve2D.
- See [Curve2D Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/classes/class_curve2d.html#class-curve2d-property-bake-interval).

### Collision Polygon Node Path

- The path to the CollisionShape that the SmartShape will use for collision.
- Is Autoset when pressing the generate collision button.

### Shape Material

- The material that this shape will use to render itself.
- For backwards compatibility `fill_texture_z_index` defaults to `-10`. Set this to `0` and enable `fill_texture_show_behind_parent` in order to preserve Godot's normal z-sorting when layering with other nodes.

### Points

- **There is no need to edit this property by hand, but you can if you'd like.**
- Contains all of the points and meta-data for the points contained in this shape.
- This data structure is updated as you manipulate the shape.

### Material Overrides

- **There is no need to edit this property by hand, but you can if you'd like.**
- When an edge is given a "Material Override" the data for that edge is stored here.
- This data structure is updated as you manipulate the shape.
